# Homework - Company Directory
Hierarchical organisation has below hierarchy of employees:<br/>
a. CEO<br/>
b. Manager. Has at least one employee reporting to him / her.<br/>
c. Employee. Reports to Manager.


## To Do
Implement a corporate directory to find the closest common Manager (aka closest to the level of employees) between two employees. <br/>
Assumption: All employees eventually report up to the CEO.

### Guidelines
Replace ambiguity with assumptions.<br/>
The directory should be an in-memory structure.<br/>
A Manager should link to Employees and not the other way around.<br/>
Flexible on wow the program takes its input and produces its output.<br/>

## Solution
Remaining<br/>
a. load employees from CSV for example on init <br/>
b. get employee nodes based on passed params
